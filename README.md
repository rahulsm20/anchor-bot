> A real-time Twitch bot that lets stream viewers request songs via chat — with support for YouTube and Spotify, a live queue, and customizable chat commands. Designed for streamers to automate music interaction and maintain control over their stream’s vibe.

## Overview

Anchor Bot is a full-stack application that connects to Twitch chat, interprets song commands from viewers, and manages a real-time playback queue. It’s split into a TypeScript-powered Next.js frontend and a Node.js backend, with PostgreSQL for storage and Redis for caching and rate limiting.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, DrizzleORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Rate Limiting**: Redis
- **Auth**: NextAuth (OAuth with Twitch) + Spotify
- **Infra**
  - Frontend
    - Vercel
  - Backend
    - GCP Cloud Run
    - Docker
- **Languages**: TypeScript

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](client/public/updated.png)

- Twitch chat messages are parsed by the backend using `tmi.js`.
- Commands are validated, rate-limited via Redis, and routed to queue handlers.
- The frontend provides real-time updates of the queue, user access management, and UI for adding/removing commands.
- Songs are fetched using YouTube and Spotify APIs and synced to a single playback queue.
